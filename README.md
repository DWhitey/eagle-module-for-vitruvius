# Eagle module for Vitruvius
Consists of Eagle (PCB-tool) metamodel and a dynamic model converter as part of Vitruvius. The Vitruvius approach implements the concept of dynamically created flexible views and is based on the Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM), but does not use a monolithic single underlying metamodel (SUM). Instead, legacy metamodels are combined in a non-invasive way to serve as a modular underlying model.
